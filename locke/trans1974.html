<p align="CENTER">LUBRICATION</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">2. The oil level should be checked at regular intervals by removing the
    oil level pipe plug #1723 at the front side of the transmission case, The oil should be
    drained after the first 10 hours operation (drain plug is located at the bottom of the
    transmission), and refilled to overflow at the oil level plug #1723 with Type A
    transmission oil. Type A transmission oil is the same as the oil used in most cars with
    automatic transmissions. Additional changes of oil should be made after each 100 hours of
    operation.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">3. The transmission requires only 12 ounces of oil and is equipped with
    a breather #1372-1 located on the cover plate #1528-1.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">4. IMPORTANT - If the transmission is always run with clean oil, it
    will outlast the rest of the machine.</p>

    follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">6. The Tractor Clutch Lever #1826 should be in the neutral position
    1/811 before hitting the stop of the #1819 bracket shown on plate 14 in the parts book.
    This adjustment can be made with the #1626 Rod End.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">7. It is necessary to lift this lever up over the stop to go into
    reverse. This pause eliminates the shock on the tractor chain, ball bearings, etc.</p>

    gasket #1739.</p>
    <p>10. Roll the machine forward or backward until the #2238 locking pin is on top. Use a
    screw driver as shown in Fig. 3 to release locking pin which locks the adjusting ring in
    one of the 51 spaces cut in the #2233 internal gear.</p>

    #1510, loosen jam nut #744 on brake adjusting screw #2296. Place screwdriver in brake
    adjusting screw and take up about one full turn of the brake screw until the brake drum #1
    536 still turns freely when the clutch lever #1826 is in the neutral position, and the
    clutch shifting fork has moved the flange of the #1533-1 clutch cone just up to the hub of
    the #1536 brake drum. Then the brake band should start to grip the drum when the clutch
    lever #1826 is pulled back for the reverse to operate.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the mower has a tendency to crawl in
    either direction when in the neutral position, it is evident that either the clutch or the
    brake band is set up too tight or the oil is too heavy or dirty.</p>

    band assemblies, replacement of friction discs, and major repairs not covered by the
    adjustment instructions.</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">17. While the transmission is still on the machine, loosen the Tractor
    Sprocket Lock Nut #1734 before removing the Tractor Chain,as this prevents the turning of
    the Sprocket Stud while removing the Lock Nut. This does not have to be done if only
    replacing the Reverse Brake Band Assembly #2290.</p>

    flange (Fig. 4).</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">28. The Flange #2289 with Oil Seal #1755 and Input Bearing -#1756 can
    now be removed and examined. If it is necessary to replace the Brake Band Assembly #2290
    remove Adjusting Screw #2296 as shown in (Fig. 4).</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">29. All of the internal mechanisms are now separated as a sub-assembly.
    To disassemble this unit a clip 3/811 wide can now be placed on the Planetary Gear Carrier
    #1555 to limit the movement of the Clutch Cone #1533-1 which will prevent the Clutch Balls
    from dropping out of their Cage when the Internal Gear #2233 is screwed off of the
    Adjusting Ring #2234, (Fig. 5).</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">30. To replace the Friction Clutch Disc #1550-1 and #1550-2. and Steel
    Discs #1551, with screw driver release locking pin (hold out), turn internal gear, and
    remove same. Remove friction and steel discs.</p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">56. Assemble the Gear Housing Cover #1527 to the Housing #2288 with
    some gasket cement to prevent leakage (Fig. 4).</p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">57. Assemble the Clutch Fork Lever #1530 and Woodruff Key #776. Insert
    Ball Check Spring #1535 and Ball #1651 in the Housing Cover as shown in Fig. 1. The lever
    #1530 should be pushed down within 1/811 of the Cover and locked with the Bolt #767 and
    Lock Nut #1861 (Fig. 4).</p>

    <p>58. Now make the final adjustments of the Clutches as outlined on Pages 3 and 4.</p>
    <p>59. After adjustments, assemble the Cover Plate #1528-1 with its Gasket #1739. Fill the
    Transmission with approximately 12 ounces Type A oil (Type A transmission oil is the same
    as the oil used in most cars with automatic transmissions) until it starts to overflow at
    the Oil Level hole on the side of the Housing #2288 (Fig. 2).</p>
    <p>60. A heavy oil will not penetrate and lubricate all parts of the Transmission and will
    ultimately cause failure. A heavy oil will also cause the discs to stick together, and the
    Forward Clutch will not release.</p>
