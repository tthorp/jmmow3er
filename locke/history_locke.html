              <td colSpan="2" height="195">The Locke Steel Chain 
              Co. was formed in 1895. S.D Locke had devised a new patented 
              method of manufacturing link chain from steel strip rather than 
              the standard method of casting. This was not only a major 
              industrial innovation but was also considered a technical triumph. 
              His son, S.D. Locke Jr., of Bridgeport, Conn., his successor, 
              began design and prototype work in the early 1920’s on a 
              self-propelled, self powered lawn mower. His interest in lawn 
              mower development was derived from his dissatisfaction with the 
              quality and performance of the mowers he had purchased for his 
              estate.&nbsp;<font size="4">He went about to develop a precision 
              cutting machine whose quality would span generations. The product 
              of this effort was the 1925 21&quot; mower, which is the forerunner of 
              a long line of mowers built to exacting standards of&nbsp; 
              performance, and durability, as well as bearing the namesake of 
              the originator.

              differential housed between two wide traction rollers, and 
              fingertip controls for reel lift and clutch engagement. So 
              successful was this first mower that it was decided to enter into 
              a manufacturing venture dedicated to the advancement and 
              production of Locke power reel mowers. A team of engineers, 
              craftsman, and planners set about the work of this project, and 
              technical achievement was evident in the fall of 1927. &nbsp;</td>

              and the dedicated people behind the Locke power reel mower proved

              <td colSpan="2" height="190">During the busy year of 
              1929, the research and development department came up with another 
              innovation. They took a 25&quot; mower frame, installed a larger 
              engine, attached side reels to the frame with special carrying 
              brackets that allowed the side reels to follow the ground contour 
              like the front reel, and designed a way to get the engine power to 
              the new side reels. Due to the fact that the 25&quot; mower was 
              originally designed and built so substantially, a different frame 
              was not needed to support the extra weight, power loads, and 
              attachments. This resulted in a mower well suited for large areas 
              with a price only nominally more than the single mower. The 
              product of this effort was the 70&quot; Locke triplex, later to become 
              known as the item #6. (See below photo of prototype triplex taken 
              October 1929). The following year, 1930, saw the introduction of 
              the 70&quot; Locke triplex mower, which would become the flagship 
              product of Locke Power Reel Mowers for the next 50 years</td>

              <td colSpan="2" height="380">In 1932, a 30&quot; 
              cut-single unit mower was introduced. Later to become known as 
              item 5 &amp; 5A, the 30&quot; single became a favorite of landscape 
              professionals. From a mowing efficiency perspective, it is 
              interesting to note that a 5&quot; increase in cutting width results in 
              a 40% increase in productivity. The 25&quot; mower can cut .5 acres per 
              hour while the 30&quot; cuts .7 acres per hour.
              <p>By 1932, the first sulkies were offered. These were ball 
              bearing units with iron wheels. 1932 also marked the first year 
              that rubber traction rollers were offered as an option. This 
              improvement proved to be so successful that, with the exception of 
              rubber shortages during the war, all mowers thereafter would be 
              shipped with rubber traction rollers. Several new advances were on 
              the horizon and in 1933 a 75&quot; triplex was offered. This mower 
              would cut at the rate of 2 acres per hour and became a favorite 
              tool of contractors and estate keepers responsible for maintaining 
              large turf areas. In 1934, pneumatic tires replaced the iron 
              wheels. Production was suspended in 1942 and resumed in 1946 as 
              very few units were shipped during World War II. </p>
              <p>In 1949, a reverse gear option was offered on the 70&quot;, and 75&quot; 
              triplex mowers. This transmission was specially designed and built 
              in the same plant as the mowers, as it is today. The reverse gear 
              transmission uses a planetary gear set, a multi-plate friction 
              pack, a brake band and drum, and is sealed with oil in its own 
              housing. The transmission simplified the handling of these heavy 
              mowers (725 pounds), and was so successful that it was offered on 
              the 25&quot; and 30&quot; mowers in 1951. (see photo below of Locke 70&quot;

              <p>The first riding mower was developed in 1971. It was known as 
              the Maxi mower. A newly designed chassis, with a front mounted 
              engine, utilized three 30&quot; reels in order to deliver an 87&quot; 
              cutting width. The heart of this mower was the new Eaton model 6 
              hydrostatic transmission that allowed unlimited variable traction 
              speeds along with reverse in the same control mechanism. </p>
              <p>In 1973, Locke reentered the golf market (A putting green mower 
              was built in the early 1930’s) with a 70&quot; triplex greens mower. 
              The new mower was called item # 7. They enjoyed only a limited run 
              and were discontinued in 1976. The Maxi mower was updated and 
              changed to the Maxi-II in 1974. </p>
              <p>1976 marked the first year of the &quot;60 series&quot;mowers. At first, 
              a 25&quot; single mower, item # 60 was offered. These machines were a 
              separate product line and were lower in cost than the &quot;standard 
              series&quot;. The sixty series mowers used belts and pulleys instead of 
              chains and sprockets. This allowed the reel and traction drives to 
              be engaged with out the clutches and related hardware. Also, a 
              welded frame replaced many castings further reducing lead times 
              and expenses. The 60 series mower grew in to a family of mowers 
              offering everything from the 25&quot; single to 70&quot; and 75&quot; reverse 
              triplex, and even included a small greensmower. After a successful 
              run, the 60 series were discontinued in 1983. They are highly 
              valued today because of the ease of maintenance and the simple 
              availability of pulleys, belts, etc. </p>
              <p>1980 saw the further evolution of the riding mower with the 
              Maxi-II (Mark-2), and later in 1984 to be renamed the Professional 
              model 1 (87&quot; cut) and the model 4 (77&quot; cut). These units had foot 
              controls and electric start Briggs &amp; Stratton 16 hp engines.</p>
              <p>1987 marked the first year Honda engines were offered as an 
              option. These proved to be very smooth running, durable engines 
              and were used as follows, 5 hp on single units or item 6C, and 8 
              hp for other triplex mowers. Because of good planning and parts 
              interchangeability, Honda engines can be fitted to any standard 
              series Locke from 1932 to present. 1988 saw the introduction of 
              the pneumatic tire drive system. This option substitutes 4 small 
              pneumatic tires for the two rubber covered drive rollers and fits 
              within the same space. These tires greatly increase traction, 
              which helps while mowing in wet or hilly conditions. These 
              developments were employed on a 70&quot; triplex with a Honda 5 hp 
              engine, making it the lightest triplex ever. It was called the 
              model 6C,&quot; Contractor&quot;. </p>
              <p>In 1996, the R &amp; D department began in earnest with a new 
              project. It was determined that a lower cost, more versatile 
              single unit mower was needed. In the spring of 1997, the new 
              product was offered as the Locke &quot;Commercial Series&quot;. It is built 
              in 25&quot; and 30&quot; cutting widths and comes equipped with a Briggs &amp; 
              Stratton 5.5hp vanguard engine. This series of mowers combine all 
              of the qualities that have made Locke a household name, with the 
              latest in manufacturing technology. This mower incorporates a 
              &quot;quick adjust&quot; height control system which allows the user to 
              adjust the height from ½&quot; to 3&quot; in a matter of seconds. This is 
              made possible due to the fact that the reel runs on a full length 
              aluminum roller instead of skid shoes, which allows the 
              overlapping of bedding areas, as well as increases the striping 
              ability of the mower. This series of mowers also feature operator 
              presence safety controls. These mowers have quickly become our 
              number one sellers worldwide and we are expecting great things in 
              the future.
